# TaaS Web API Server

## Quick start

### Start the server

Switch to the root directory which has a `package.json` file and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

To run a server with supervisor (restart automatically):

```
npm run forever
```

## Configuration

You may want to change the `config.yml` file to run the server with a different configuration.
